First object-oriented game i ever made. This gamed served a purpose of letting me try new things. I implemented 3 levels of bots in this game, gave them random movements, solved problems of moving/shooting/ducking at the same time. Game itself isn't very complex or interesting but this is the game i learned the most from. I learned how to use sprites for moving objects, control jumping motion, recognize colision, and make shooting motion seem natural.
